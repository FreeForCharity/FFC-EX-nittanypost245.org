          Chartered on October 19, 1919, with Theodore D. Boal as our first commander, we have been
          proudly serving the State College and Centre County community for over 100 years. Known
          locally as &quot;The Legion in the Woods,&quot; our post at 1950 Pine Hall Road is a
          historic gathering place providing camaraderie and support to those who served.
